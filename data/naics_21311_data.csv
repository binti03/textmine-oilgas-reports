Kenai had 250 employees. It provided drilling services for the exploration and development of oil, gas, and geothermal wells. Employee #1 had worked for Kenai Drilling Limited for over six years. He had been promoted to the position of driller two weeks before the accident. Kenai Drilling had been using a new rig, Rig #17, on the Ventura Aera Energy Lease for four months before the accident. It had a year contract with Aera. Average time on a well was 10 to 15 days. The crew would drill a well and then move on. On the day before the accident, Employee #1 and 12 other crew employees began to break down Rig #17 in preparation to move it to a new location. On the day of the accident, the crew moved the rig to a new drilling location. The sub-bases had been set and the mast had been placed on the floor to prepare it to be raised. The crane was hooked to the strong part of the ""A"" legs, their back, before driving the releasing pin from the ""A"" leg to separate it from the mast. The driller, Employee #1, climbed up onto the lower ""A"" leg to pass a wrench to a coworker who was standing on top of the mast. At that point, the motorman knocked out the top releasing pin from the ""A"" leg. The leg fell, pinning Employee #1 between the ""A"" leg and the mast section. He sustained a fatal crushing injury to his pelvis as a result. The ""A"" legs had two releasing pins that could be removed, one on top of the other. The top pin was never to be removed during rig-up or rig-down operations. The removal of the lower releasing pin allowed the ""A"" legs to be rocked back. Workers from T & T Crane were onsite, and they were able to lift the leg and free Employee #1. Emergency medical services were called, but due to the remote location, it took medical personnel approximately 45 minutes to reach the accident site. Employee #1 died as medics were ready to hoist him off the platform and into a helicopter. He died of the crushing injuries to his pelvis. Interviews were conducted of the crew and supervisors. The investigation concluded that the employer, Kenai Drilling Limited, ""had not trained the employee on which pin to knock out on the 'A' legs."" The narrative did not make clear whether this comment referred to the motorman who removed the pin in this incident, Employee #1, or its employees in general. Further, the employer did not recognize the hazard of someone's standing on the lower ""A"" leg when the releasing pin was being knocked out. These violations resulted in the issuance of two Serious citations for CCR, Title 8, 6507, referencing 3203(a)(4) & (7). The Division also issued a Serious Accident Related citation for 3328(e), due to the employer's not making sure that equipment components were secured.

After moving the BOP approximately 10 feet, it was unhooked and left free standing, next to the pump truck. With the BOP freestanding, an employee decided to tie the BOP to the pump truck with a rope, so it wouldn't fall onto the employees working on the well head. While employees were working on the well head, an employee working behind the pump truck was attaching lines to the pump. He was not able to fit one of the lines and therefore, had the driver pull the pump truck forward, approximately three feet. The driver moved the truck up and pulled the BOP along with it.

The employee then picked up the male end of the rotating drill pipe and held it at approximately hip level, while a coworker attempted to attach a second 10-ft length of pipe to the first section of pipe the employee was holding. The coworker heard the employee, who had his back to the drill rig yell as his clothing had became tangled in the rotating pipe he was holding. The employee was entangled and knocked to the ground by the rotating drill pipe before the coworker could get to the drill rig controls, approximately 20 feet away, and stop the rotation, as the drill head had been set in the rotating position at approximately 11 to 12 rpms to facilitate threading of the pipe sections. The coworker then returned to the employee and untangled him from the drill pipe. The coworker noticed that the employee was unresponsive with a head injury, unequal pupils and labored, gurgling breathing. The coworker immediately got on the radio to request help. Other coworkers arrived within minutes to provide first aid; they made a stretcher from a ladder and clothing, carefully rolled the employee onto the stretcher while supporting his head and placed him into the bed of a pickup truck.

They were preparing to insert a 30-foot section of drilling pipe into the nearly 6,500-foot-long drilling string. Their coworker, the driller, was operating the draw works. He had pulled most of the kelly out of the well, when he felt a bump. Employees #1 and #3 were on the west side of the drill rig, preparing to connect the kelly to the new section of drill pipe, while Employee #2 was on the racking board, preparing the power tongs to disengage the kelly from the string. Suddenly, there was a loud noise, and the crown sheave shaft came out of one of its mounts, allowing the five sheaves, the drilling line, the 165,000-pound drilling string, and the blocks to fall to the drilling floor. Employee #1's right leg was trapped under the blocks and nearly amputated. He sustained severe blood loss, and he was killed as a result of his lacerations.

The driller had minor abrasions and contusions. This is no mention of him on the injury lines. The reason that the shaft pulled out of one of its pillar blocks was that the shaft retaining bolt (similar to a set screw) did not sufficiently penetrate the shaft receptacle. This oversight allowed the end of the shaft move about and enlarge the pillar block shaft hole. After a while, the shaft end could move in and out of the pillar block, until, by the time of the accident, the shaft pulled entirely free of the pillar block. Then the second pillar block's supporting steel structure failed, letting the freed shaft end deflect downwards and allowing the unrestrained sheaves to fall. Underlying these failures were inadequate inspections of the mast, including the crown assembly. The moving shaft had distended the pillar block, causing an observable gap between the two. Two cracks, not associated with the accident, were observed on the crown structure. Two bolts and a nut were found on the crown after the accident; their placement could not be ascertained, and they were not damaged.

They prepared to shut down the well and check the condition of the choke valves. The well was shut down by closing the high pressure well, flowing at approximately at 4,000 psi, isolation valve with a remotely controlled-pneumatically operated valve and the secondary well isolation valve. These valves were located about 10-in. apart and when they both were closed a portion of pressurized gas was trapped between them. Next, they closed the line, flowing approximately at 1,000 psi, isolation valve to ensure that gas would not back-up into the open choke valves. The lines connecting the pneumatic valve and the line isolation valve were bled to atmospheric pressure. During this process two pressure sensors initiated a beeper-horn-siren to signal that the high pressure and the low pressure lines had lost pressure. Once the line was at atmospheric pressure, they popped the head from the high pressure choke valve. As Employee #1 and a roustabout were removing the seat from this valve, a coworker was trying to communicate to them but the beeper-horn-siren was too loud.

At this time, the depth of the hole was 11,908.2 ft. During the process of adding a section of pipe the evening tower crew dropped the pipe string about six feet. After picking up the pipe string and setting the Kelly, drilling commenced for approximately 100 feet. Because the pipe string was dropped, the decision was made to trip the hole and check the ""bottom-hole assembly"" bit and mud motor. After tripping to 4,289.8 ft, the chain on the input sprocket for the draw works became loose breaking teeth on the sprocket and shutting down the operation. The sprocket had to be replaced before drilling operations could continue. With the sprocket replaced, the Pusher was on the brake handle and picked up on the slips to see if the pipe would move. It would not. He estimated the down-hole string weight was approximately 150,000 pounds. They could pull up to 70 percent of the string weight. The rotary transmission was placed in low, low/forward, with the table rotating in a clockwise direction. They picked up the pipe string and pulled to 220,000 pounds, rotating the rotary clockwise while attempting to drill through the stuck position. This procedure was not only stretching the drill pipe but also twisting and coiling it as well. The attempt to drill through the stuck position was not successful. The crew had the pipe string in the slips and then rotated (counter-clockwise) untwisting the pipe string. The Pusher picked up on the Kelly to change the saver sub that had pulled threads from the previous hole. Once the new sub was placed in the pipe string, Employee #1, the driller, went into the doghouse to get the chain tongs. The chain tong was fitted with a 37-in. handle and is designed to grip pipe in either direction. Returning to the drill floor, Employee #1 placed the chain tong on the saver sub to tighten it up. The assistant driller raised the Kelly approximately 3-in. to 4-in. above the saver sub, to make it easier to tighten the sub to the pipe string. When Employee #1 began to tighten the saver sub to the pipe string, the pipe string began to uncoil (counter-clockwise) at a very high rate of speed. While Employee #1 was holding onto the handle of the chain tong, he was lifted from the drill floor and forced backwards into the draw works causing him to loose his grip on the handle. Employee #1 began falling to the drill floor. As the pipe was uncoiling, the handle on the chain tong struck Employee #1 several times to the body and head before reaching the drill floor.

He was wrapping a wire rope sling around the outside of the internally threaded end of a 33-foot long drill pipe. This procedure involved wrapping the sling around the pipe twice and passing the loop of one end of the sling through the loop on the other end of the sling. This wrap is referred to as a ""choke"". After the sling was attached to the winch line, the ""motorman"" applied tension to the winch line. As the end of the pipe attached to the winch began to lift, the other end of the pipe rolled off the right side of the storage platform, and the attached end of the pipe swung to the left, striking Employee #1 in the chest and knocking him though the opening of the storage area.

The foreman called 911 as employees attempted CPR. Emergency medical personnel arrived, and Employee #1 was pronounced dead at the scene. The coroner's preliminary finding lists the causes of death as hypothermia and drowning. Employee #1, a rig hand for the last three months for Rose Run Drilling Co., was working the fourth shift on the fifth day of a ten-day gas drilling project. There are four six-hour shifts per day, and the fourth shift runs from 3:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. The gas drilling site, in Niles, Ohio, is leased by Everflow Eastern, the well drilling company. The chemical being applied to the water retention pit was ""Black Hills Gel,"" or Wyoming bentonite, which becomes very slippery when mixed with water, as stated in the MSDS. It is added to help retard the foam that builds up as a result of the drilling. The lighting conditions were very poor in and around the mud pit. There were three 500 watt halogen lights around the work site, but none were located in the pit area. First responders had to use flashlights to light the accident scene. The mud pit was 70 feet long, 34 feet wide, and 12 to 14 feet deep, with an 80 to 85 degree downward slope toward the center of the pit. The temperature on the morning of the accident was in the single digits, with snow and ice on the ground. The edges of the mud pit were very slippery because of the snow, ice, and mud on the black plastic mill pit liner that extends 4 to 5 feet around the edge of the entire pit. There was no barrier in place around the pit, and there weren't any fall arrest devices being used at the time of the accident.

0950643,11/16/2002,,Burn/Scald(Heat),Caza Drilling (California) Inc.,"At approximately 2:20 a.m. on November 16, 2002, a five man crew was drilling on Rig Number 513 to a depth of approximately 1,280 ft. The drill pipe string had a drill bit consisting of three rotating pieces. The drill bit is wider than the diameter of the pipe. The parts of the oil drilling rig consist of a mud pump, stand pipe, kelly, drill pipe, annulus, drill collar bit, and mud pits with shaker boxes. As the bit drills the crew adds more pipe and pumps mud via the kelly down the center of the pipe. The mud lubricates the bit and acts as a medium for debris to be brought to the surface and it compresses any gas based on the weight of the mud. If the weight is too little the gases can escape. As the drill bit bores it creates a bore hole. The space between the outer surface of the pipe and the edge of the bore hole is called the annulus. As mud is pumped through the center of the pipe it comes out through the bit. All of the debri comes up with the mud coming up through the annulus. Once the depth had been reached, the crew started pulling up the drill pipe stem, five sections at a time or about 300 ft. Once they removed 300 ft, they would pump mud back into the bore hole to make up the volume difference. In order to remove the pipe stem, they must shut down the mud pumps. They were removing the pipe stem when they noticed the mud was starting to flow. The company man, who is in charge, ordered that the mud weight be decreased from 11 to 10.5 or 10.6 pounds per gallon. If an incorrect mud weight is used the mud will exert less pressure than the formation pressure within the zone and the gases will escape. At the bottom of the rig is a device called a blowout preventer, which consists of a set of rams that shuts the annulus keeping the gases from escaping. The immediate use of the blowout preventer is considered a hard shut in. A hard shut would be inappropriate since the gases would be blocked so abruptly the pressure could escape through the path of least resistance. The company man ordered a soft shut in, in the event of a kickback or blowout. The soft shut is a set of procedures that the rig crew undertakes to relieve the gas pressure. Unfortunately, the crew had only time to make one decision due to the shallowness of the well. Once the crew noticed the flow, they tried to stab the kelly onto the drill pipe stem so they could pump mud into the well. The pressure of the gases pushing up the mud was so great they could not screw the kelly onto the pipe. The kickback went uncontrolled and the blowout occurred, sending flames hundreds of feet into the air. Employee #1, a derrickman, who worked on the monkey board about 60 to 75 ft above grade, was burned beyond recognition and found on a ladder located on the derrick platform.

0830500,10/01/2002,,Cut/Laceration,Hayes Petroleum,"On October 1, 2002, Employee #1 was standing on a winch (drawworks) to reach across and close a brake cover on the far end of the winch, while working on an oil/gas drilling rig. While he was on the winch drum, the winch operator activated the winch which caused the winch drum to turn and the cable to slap as the drum started running. The motion of the drum and the action of the wire rope cable lacerated Employee #1's body and pulled him downwards between the drum and the winch frame, killing him. The cable crossed his body diagonally in an upward direction, which also caused his chest to be severely constricted. Although the brake bands on each end of the drawworks had covers, no guards were installed on the drum and cable to prevent injuries. Guarding over top of the winch drum would have kept an employee from standing directly on the drum and cable and from being pulled into the winch between the cable and drum. Prior to the accident, the brake band covers had been opened and the brakes adjusted without implementation of any lockout/tagout procedures. Appropriate lockout/tagout procedures, with the closure of brake covers to complete brake adjustment activities, would have eliminated employee exposure to winch/cable motion while the equipment was being operated.",Fatality

0625700,08/18/2002,,Burn/Scald(Heat),Tetra Technologies Inc,"At approximately 3:00 a.m. on August 18, 2002, Employees #1 through #5 were flowing a well into a frac tank at the site of the Raymos Investment Number 1 Well, approximately 4 miles north of Pierre Part, Louisiana. Drilling had started on this well on February 26, 2002 and was completed on August 14, 2002. The rig was removed and completion work started the following day when the crew had begun to perforate the well. At a depth of approximately 75 feet, the wire line attached to the perforating gun gave out and the gun became hung up in the well head. The employer pumped methanol into the hole to free the perforating gun. The wire line rams cut both the electric and logging lines, causing the tools to fall to the bottom. The employer removed the tools before beginning to test the well, which started on the night of August 17 and continued into the morning of August 18. During the testing, oil and water from the well was flowed into the frac tanks near the well head. The frac tank containing the oil was approximately two-thirds full, meaning the capacity for vapor accumulation was severely reduced. At some point prior to the accident, Employee #5, the well testing contractor, gauged the frac tanks and determined that they were filling faster than expected. At approximately 2:30 a.m., a request was made to Settoon Industries, a local contractor, to have a suction truck come to the site to remove some of the fluids from the frac tanks. At about this same time, Employee #1, the drilling foreman, contacted Employee #2, the production technician, to come to the site to look at the problem. When Employee #2 arrived at the site, he was accompanied by his son, Employee #3. When the suction truck arrived at the site, Employee #4, the driver, was directed to position the truck with the rear of the tanker close to the frac tanks and the tractor angled toward the office trailers. The driver left the truck running and walked to the front of the frac tanks to speak with the other four workers. Employee #4 then turned and began to walk back to his truck when a flash fire ignited around the frac tank that contained the oil. All five employees sustained severe burns and were transported to the Burn Unit at the Baton Rouge General Hospital where they were hospitalized. Approximately 10 days later, Employee #4 died from complications of his injuries. Subsequent investigation into the cause of the fire determined that no one was smoking near the frac tank nor was anyone using a cell phone or two-way radios. The flare was operating at the time, but the 60 foot tall stack was located approximately 160 feet away. Prior to the flash, one witness observed a blue flame propagating near the base of the frac tank. It was hot and humid and, since there was no wind, hydrocarbon vapors were accumulating along the ground near the frac tanks, although the concentration of the vapors was less than the LEL. Because the flame proceeded toward the rear of the frac tank, this suggests that vapors were also escaping from a open hatch at the rear of the tank. The physical evidence indicated that when the fire reached the area of the rear hatch, the flame went vertical and up the side of the tank until the vapor concentration exceeded the LEL. On the inside of the frac tank, the inlet hose opening was flush with the top of the vessel. As oil flowed from the hose into the tank, a static charge developed at the opening since the oil was splash loaded and a ""T"" deflector or conductive down spout with a 45-degree bevel at the end was not installed near the end of the down spout. The vapor concentration inside the vessel was under the LEL and any static charge would not cause the vapor to explode until it exceeded the LEL. The two sources of hydrocarbons coupled with the perfect weather conditions suggests that it was only a matter of time before an explosion would occur. The origin of the blue flame was not determined. Employees #1 and #3 through #5 all had on cotton clot",Hospitalized injury
0950633,08/14/2002,,Fracture,Southwest Pump & Drilling,"At approximately 8:30 a.m. on August 14, 2002, Employee #1 of Southwest Pump and Drilling was instructed to drop off a flatbed trailer, which was loaded with 24 steel pipes at the Coachella Valley Water District storage yard. When Employee #1 arrived at the site, a forklift operator told him to use a Caterpillar Number 806, Model Number V130, serial Number 3V10407, to unload the pipes. Employee #1 got out of the cab of the truck and started removing the nylon and chain straps that secured the pipes during the transport. He was on the right side of the flatbed trailer, bent over putting the straps inside the utility box when he heard a loud noise. The forklift operator was on the opposite side of the trailer attempting, with some difficulty, to get the forks between the pipes. He managed to get two pipes on the forklift and was tilting back when he noticed a pipe from the other side rolling underneath the trailer. The operator backed up, turned off his vehicle, and went around the trailer, where he found Employee #1 on the ground. He was struck by the steel pipe that rolled off the trailer.
