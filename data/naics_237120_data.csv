They were removing a load of boring rods from a flatbed trailer. The rods had been transported to the country club parking lot in a semi-trailer, but they then had been transferred to a smaller flatbed trailer, because it was able to navigate the makeshift road to the excavation site. The transfer of the rods had been accomplished using a backhoe with front fork attachments. Upon the flatbed trailer's arrival at the excavation site, Employee #1 and Coworker #1 proceeded to remove the boring rods. The rods, which were 10 feet long and 260 pounds each, were organized into bundles of 10 rods. Each bundle was configured so there were two rows of five rods metal-banded together, with one row on top of the other and planking separating the two rows. Using a trackhoe (excavator), Employee #1 attempted to lift an entire bundle of 10 rods from the trailer without cutting the banding. The load proved to be unstable. He then attempted to cut the banding and remove five rods at a time. This, too, proved to be unstable, so he proceeded to remove one rod at a time. A bundle's lower layer was successfully unloaded on the side of the trailer where the excavator was placed. In preparation for removing the top row from the bundle, Employee #1 cut its banding from the side of the trailer opposite the excavator. With nothing to hold the rods in place, and due to a slight tilt of the trailer, the top layer of five rods began to roll toward Employee #1. Four of the rods fell from the trailer, striking and knocking Employee #1 to the ground. Employee #1 was killed. This fatality was investigated by Iowa OSHA. During its subsequent investigation, it was determined that, at the moment of the fatality, Coworker #2 was located on the opposite side of the trailer, across from Employee #1.

At 7:00 a.m., a hot work permit, Number 420446, had been issued for hot work on the Number #1 Lift Station Oil Trap-Whole Bay. At approximately 11:00 a.m., another of the contractor's work crews removed an air blower from an overflow pit adjacent to the oil trap and placed metal covers over the top of the overflow pit. The air blower had been used to keep hydrocarbon vapors from backing up into the overflow box. About two hours later, this same work crew anchored a come-along to a valve box and used it to move one of the metal covers into place. This valve box was bolted to the metal plate sitting on the northern half of the overflow pit. Anchoring the come-along to the valve box caused the plate holding the valve box to flex, breaking the vapor seal along the north side of the plate. Despite these two changes in the conditions adjacent to the southeast corner of the lift station oil trap, the hot work permit was not terminated. At approximately 3:46 p.m., a coworker was using a cutting torch to cut a diamond plate adjacent to the northwest corner of the overflow pit. Employee #1 was setting up to weld north of the coworker-helper. The torch operator was east of the coworker-helper and was attempting to fight a fire when he noticed material burning next to the cutting operation. At that time, the hydrocarbon vapors ignited and a flash of flames shot out from under the plate covering the north side of the overflow pit. Employee #1 sustained second-drgree burns to the left side of his face, for which he was hospitalized for five days. The coworker-helper suffered second-degree burns to small areas on his left hand and on the back of his left leg. He was trabsposted to the hospital, where he was treated and released.
